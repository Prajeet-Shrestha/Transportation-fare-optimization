The project Transportation Fare Optimization aims to automate the process of calculating the cheapest travel route between two locations. The app provides a graphical user interface that allows the user to select the source and destination and then calculate the cheapest route by fare or travel distance and display it to the user. The app also provides information about the amount of money that a user will save if they take the shortest route and the representation of the output in a map.

## 1.2. Objectives
The project ' Transportation Fare Optimization Application ' is an algorithm modeling and development project to find the best optimal path that requires the lowest cost to travel from one point to next; along with the following objectives:
  1. To implement any path finding Algorithm
  2. To be able to optimize the route as per the transportation fare
  3. To be able to tell when to switch transports
  4. To provide easy feedback to the user in the form of a map

## 1.3. Project Assumption 
An assumption is any project factor that is considered to be true, real, or certain without empirical proof or demonstration. Realistically, itâ€™s impossible to plan a project without making a few assumptions. The key is knowing how to spot those assumptions and putting safeguards in place so that if any assumption is proven false, the impact on project delivery will be minimal. The assumptions that were made are:
  1. The route is always free with no traffic.
  2. Each node has 3 abstract nodes each node for Bus, MiniBus and Tempo.
  3. The Person is always in the initial location
